**Important Considerations:
Code Specificity: While providing full, platform-specific code is beyond the scope due to varying IAM APIs and security practices, this response offers a foundational framework and highlights key considerations.
Ethical Development: Emphasize responsible coding practices and avoid including code that could manipulate real cloud environments without proper authorization.
Focus on Concepts: The emphasis is on understanding the project's functionalities and how automation can enhance IAM security.

**Key Considerations:
Replace placeholders with specific libraries and API calls for your chosen cloud platform (AWS, Azure, GCP).
Implement secure configuration loading to avoid exposing credentials in code.
Ensure proper authorization checks and access controls before performing actions on real cloud environments.
Focus on automation using schedulers (e.g., AWS CloudWatch Events, Azure Automation Scheduled Jobs) to run these functions periodically.
Integrate with cloud monitoring services (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor) for continuous monitoring and notification of security events.
